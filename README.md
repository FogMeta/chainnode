## Introduction
Chainsnap is a project for maintaining blockchain snapshots. This project enables the storing and retrieval of snapshots for blockchain projects including Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, Filecoin, Near, Pocket, and Polygon. 

**Main Features:**

  - Full backup of the completed and minimal snapshots (if it exists) of each chain every once in a while
 
  - Maintain the original download links of the snapshots and the metadata (CSV and JSON format) after preprocessing.
  - Each piece will be sent to storage providers in the Filecoin network through [Swan Client](https://github.com/filswan/go-swan-client), and the metadata of the deal (including filename, dealCID, MinerID, etc.) will be maintained in the repository;
  - Mint deal metadata to an NFT in the [Opensea platform](https://opensea.io/), everyone can see it at any time

**How to retrieve it:**
  - Get all pieces of each snapshot from snapshot metadata
  - Get storage providers that store all pieces from the deal metadata
  - Fetch all the pieces using the [Lotus retrieval function](https://lotus.filecoin.io/tutorials/lotus/store-and-retrieve/retrieve-data/#send-a-retrieval-request)
  - Merge all pieces to the complete snapshot

It is worth noting that all deal metadata will be mint to the Opensea platform through [multichain storage](https://www.multichain.storage/) to ensure that will never be lost
